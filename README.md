# change-detection-II: matlab and visual basic code for modeling decision-making during uncertainty

This project aims to understand how subjects make perceptual decisions when faced with sensory uncertainty . 

This repo contains my experiment and analysis code for a psychophysics task that tests a subject's visual working memory and perceptual decision-making. Here, we compared a Bayesian-optimal model with two subptiomal models of decision-making.

The "ExperimentCode" folder contains code written in Visual Basic to run the task. 

The "SanityChecks" folder runs several tests to make sure that the models were derived accurately before we fit them to the behavioral data. 

The "AnalysisCode" folder contains code written in Matlab for analyzing behavioral data, generating model predictions, and fitting the models to the data.

Once the manuscript is published, I will post a link to it here. If you want to find out more, feel free to contact me.
